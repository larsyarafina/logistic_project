# ðŸ“¦ US Logistics Performance Analysis with AI for Supply Chain Optimization
**Project Overview**

**Objective:**\
This project is to analyze the US Logistics Performance Dataset, create meaningful insights about shipping efficiency, cost factors, and delays, and propose actionable recommendations to improve logistics performance.

**Background**\
Logistics directly impacts the efficiency of operational costs and competitiveness. By analyzing this dataset, companies and policymakers can identify performance bottlenecks, optimize routes, and invest in infrastructure more effectively.

**Problem Statement:**\

**Approach:**\

**Analysis Process**\
1. Data Ingestion and Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Modeling
5. Clustering and Segmentation
6. Insight and Findings
7. Conclusions and Recommendations

## Role of AI
* Summarization: Turn raw EDA results into an executive-friendly report.
* Hypothesis Generation: Suggest potential root causes (e.g., bottlenecks, customs delays).
* Recommendations Drafting: Generate business-oriented action plans.
* Interpretability Aid: Explain model results (feature importance) in plain language.
